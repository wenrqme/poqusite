There's chaos and panic in cat town after a giant appears!

In early sketches I wasn't sure about what to put in the back-- I originally had a human child but I decided I wanted to keep the kitty society artwork to be mostly of cat activities and conflicts. There's early concept art of the selfie cat too :3

For colors I wanted it to be warmer than the drawings I've been doing lately. Most of these color thumbs are pretty weak since I only put warm colors down-- In the end I made the fourth one trying to balance it with cool shadows so it would be easier on the eyes to look at.
