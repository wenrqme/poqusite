A colorful town of people who wear bird masks and try to live like birds.

Before coloring I did sketch out a few different color scheme ideas. I tried different leaves mostly, because I wanted the trees to be colorful, but I ended up settling for the less "loud" blue in the end. I'm still working on being able to be more bold with my colors, and that is a work in progress.
