My year of the snake art for the lunar new year! I had originally planned to have more red lanterns and the like, but ended up sticking to just the red accent on the qipao.

Looking through the process I feel like I can hear the audiobook I was listening to while drawing in all the scales. Rendering this whole thing was more of a relaxing process, where I wasn't thinking too hard about the drawing as a whole, but just drawing in the details.

I also made a version with possibly tacky gold writing to send to family group chats!
