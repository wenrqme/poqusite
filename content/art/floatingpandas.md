Panda ghosts for spooky season in 2023!

I initially wanted to focus on drawing the street/alleyway with this lighting in mind, but as I was thinking about it I thought it would be a cute place for the panda ghosts to float around in.

Color wip! The coloring was more straightforward since I knew vaguely what I wanted-- for the alley to be in shadow with the back street being brightly lit (from the thumbnail). I decided to also light up the front more too with the interaction between the panda and the cat, and to break up the shadow a bit.
