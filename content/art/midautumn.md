A little piece for the mid autumn festival. I wanted a closely packed area full of props near the walls to give off a warm and cozy feeling.

I've been focusing on my lineart, and it was a big part of my drawing process for this. I wanted more variation in line width and for my lines not to feel too structured with some sketchiness here and there.
