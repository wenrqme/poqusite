Crocs and cats living together. I wanted to focus a lot more on improving my lighting skills for this drawing. I tried to make the shadows and lights more clear than my previous art.

For my initial idea I just wanted to design an outdoor space for crocodiles. I was inspired from running around Animal Crossing and imagining decorations I wanted-- the end result might be quite different from Animal Crossing though!

(There's also a little bonus sketch of the cats fishing on the croc's back. I thought of this as a separate drawing when I was planning this out. The idea of the two cats hugging on the crocs back led to this of cats going out fishing)

In the end I altered the composition a little bit to have some foreground elements framing the piece. It makes it feel a little more closed in and cozy (more like we are there, rather than just looking at a picture).

For my efforts on making more obvious lighting, I did initial color thumbnails over the art. I stuck with the second version of these, trying to keep the shadows very similar in color, so that the details are not jumping out as much in those areas. This way, the eyes attention is hopefully drawn more towards the center, whereas in the first version, it would be drawn to the top left of the image

This is a wip of the coloring before I warmed it up a bit. I still like how this cooler look looks.
