A gooey bird library where the birds help with getting books from the shelves.

Here are some sketches for the character and bird design, and library design:

I always found bookshelves pretty intimidating to draw since they have a lot of detail and uniformity. I don't think I drew them in a way I'm most happy with in this drawing-- Next time I draw a library/bookshelves I want to make them more wonky and less uniform.
