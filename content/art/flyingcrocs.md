I was just imagining a world where crocodiles fly. While drawing this I wanted to solve an issue I had with my previous drawings where it felt like very muddy at times, especially in the backgrounds. Most of the coloring here was done with only a regular circle brush with no opacity property to make my colors feel more solid. I only used an opacity brush for larger gradients overall like in the sky.
