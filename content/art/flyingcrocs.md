I was just imagining a world where crocodiles fly. I felt my coloring/painting in some of my other drawings felt a bit muddy, so for this one most of my coloring was done with just the hard circle brush (no special opacity property). I used an opacity brush for bigger gradients and the clouds, and I didn't use any smudging/blending properties in my brushes. I think this works pretty well for the cartoonish way I draw, but I might try to bring back blending again later when I think I can pull it off.

My thumbnails and "scrap paper" for planning/editing things while drawing:

and a wip I kinda like the looks of : )

I tend to naturally select dull colors like in this wip, but I try my best to make my finished art brighter (though I do also like dull colors a lot).
