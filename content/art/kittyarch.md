With some of the recent pencil-y drawings, I've tried fitting them together as one town/world. I made a map of one potential layout, but it doesn't necessarily stick accurately to the illustrations

The central point of the map is based on the tulou from fujian province. I have hakka ancestry and have always thought those communal homes are so beautiful! I would love to draw more based on it in the future.
