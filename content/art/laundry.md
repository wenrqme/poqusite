This my first time trying to work on an interior for the purpose of having an interior. It's very impractical, but the crocodile's presence is cute to me.

Since I wanted to get some practice in with interiors, it was initially just a laundry room, but I eventually added a crocodile, and then it turned into a room with water on the floor, however impractical. I thought having lots of props would make it feel more home-y.

Partway through coloring I tried out how i might want to make ripples in the water and make it look like water, so I practiced small-scale on the thumbnail. And then I played with hue and saturation to see what colors I liked.

Initially the shirt on the girl was yellow, with various deep brownish-reddish colors on the props. To me, these colors didn't feel very coherent and my eye didn't know where to look. I ended up changing this so that the only strong red color was at the shirt. I think this helps draw the eye to the girl more than the background elements.
