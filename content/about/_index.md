Hi, I'm poqu! I love making illustrations, and I put a lot of focus on designing and drawing the backgrounds and environments.


Most of my art is done in Procreate, but I do also use Clip Studio Paint.

(Recently, I added my wips and thumbnails on my website for the drawings I saved those for. It's partly so I can look back on them to remember what worked and what didn't for my art and use this info for the next piece :))
