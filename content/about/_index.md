Hi, I'm poqu! I love making illustrations, and I've been putting more focus on backgrounds and environments lately.

A lot of my recent drawings have been of a concept of communities of people who wear animal hats/costumes and live in a similar fashion to the animals. Many settings and people I've drawn are a part of that world and its aesthetic. I've working on this as a world building idea with my friend (@dizzy_bone on twitter) and I'm excited to see where it goes :D

Most of my art is done in Procreate, but I do also use Clip Studio Paint.
