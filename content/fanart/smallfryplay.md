Some smallfry playing hopscotch! I really wanted to draw a background inspired by the maps and aesthetic of Salmon Run.

The sketches were really fun to do, I was doing it initially with a more "doodle-y" mindset, not really planning too much how I wanted it to look. The grates over the top are vaguely based on the grates on Marooner's Bay in Salmon Run.

I was having trouble visualizing the lighting I wanted, so I made a pretty crude model of my background in blender to help me.

This is a wip with the lighting blocked in before I went in to paint the details : )
