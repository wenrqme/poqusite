A Splatoon x Witch Hat Atelier crossover! I started reading Witch Hat Atelier recently and I love the art and witch outfits. I wanted to draw Coco as an inkling since I'm also still in a Splatoon phase.

There isn't much of it, but I did include some hatching to match some vibes from the manga.

I also drew Tetia as an inkling since I thought her hair would be cute!
