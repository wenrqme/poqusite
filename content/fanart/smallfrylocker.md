This inkling has been keeping smallfry >_>

This started off as me just wanting to make a small drawing for Splatoon 3, and I didn't intend to make a full background for it.

I actually completely finished this drawing from the small idea before changing my mind to extend it all the way. But since this started as more of a doodle, the way I drew it wasn't really scalable. It felt like if I extended this directly, then the final drawing would appear incorrect.

I redrew almost everything from the start with a more consistent perspective and added more props to fill the canvas. In the end, I don't know if one is better or worse than the other, but I guess I just have 2 drawings of the same thing now :')
