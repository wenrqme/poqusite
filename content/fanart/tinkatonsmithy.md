Tinkaton from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet! I love this design so much, and I thought the blacksmith theme was really cute. Tinkaton is probably more of a menace, but I wanted to draw a more cozy scene and create a workshop for her.

There's a little side detail where she is making the evolution armors for the charcadet line. It probably doesn't work in canon, but maybe it could be a thing in a mystery dungeon game ToT

This was the first doodle for my backsmith tinkaton idea, mostly centered around the charcadet armor :')
