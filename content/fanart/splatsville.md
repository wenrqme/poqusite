I drew this in excitement for Splatoon3. It's my inkling exploring the new city!

Here are some initial sketches: There was a different pose I actually felt looked cuter and more dynamic, but I ended up using the one I chose because it better matched the background composition I wanted (to me), and it had a strong/clear silhouette.
